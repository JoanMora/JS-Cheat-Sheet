# JS-Cheat-Sheet
Hopefully best practices in modern JS.

## Variable declarations
### var, let & const
`const` is the most strict declaration. It can't be reassigned. Should be used as default whereever possible.

`let` is the second strict declaration and should be used for iteration counter.

`var` is the less strict declaration and should be avoided when possible.


Once variables with `let` or `const` are declared, any attemp to declare them again will fail.
