# JS-Cheat-Sheet
Hopefully best practices in modern JavaScript (ES6 and beyond).

## Variable declarations
### var, let & const
`const` is the most strict declaration and can't be reassigned. It should be used as default whereever possible.

`let` is the second strict declaration and can be reassigned. It should be used for iteration counter.

`var` is the less strict declaration and should be avoided when possible.


Once variables with `const` or `let` are declared, any attemp to declare them again will fail.

### Declare all variables of a function on top of it
Because of "Hoisting" problems.

### Shorthands with ES6 destructuring
```
const [t, u] = ['a', 'b'];
t; // 'a'
u; // 'b'
```

```
const { type, payload } = action;
type; // content of action.type
payload; // content of action.payload
```

## Types
### Arrays
An ordered list of values.

`const arr = [2, 4, 6];`

#### filter() | map() | reduce()
```
arr.filter(x => x > 2); // [4, 6]

arr.map(x => x * 2); // [4, 8, 12]

arr.reduce((acc, n) => acc + n, 0); // 10

// arr itself gets never mutated, always a new array is returned
```

## Objects
In JavaScript, all types of functions, arrays, key/value pairs, and data structures in general are really objects.

### Prototypes
A prototype is an object intended to model other objects after. It is similar to a class in that you can use it to construct any number of object instances, but different in the sense that it is an object itself. There are two ways that prototypes can be used: you can delegate access to a single, shared prototype object (called a delegate), or you can make clones of the prototype.

#### Delegate Prototypes
```
var colorProto = {
   setColorName: function setColor(setColorName) {
      this.colorName = newColor;
      return this;
   },

   colorName: 'white'
   rgb: {
      r: 255, g: 255, b: 255
   }
},
white = Object.create(colorProto),
red = Object.create(colorProto).setColorName('red');

white.colorName; //white
red.colorName; //red

red.rgb.r = 0; // also sets white.rgb.r to 0 -> Object and array mutations are shared!

red.rgb = {r: 255, g: 0, b: 0}; // only sets red.rgb to 255,0,0 -> Property replacement is instance-specific!
```

#### Prototype Cloning
Sometimes you don't want to share data on a prototype property. Instead, you want each instance to have its own unique copy of the prototype's properties.

Instead:
`switch1 = Object.create(switchProto);`

use:
`switch1 = Object.assign({}, switchProto);`

The primary difference between cloning and delegation is that cloning will copy the value of each property for every object instance, whereas delegation is more memory efficient. It stores only one copy of each default property setting until you need to override properties at the instance level.

As it turns out, it's often a good idea to employ a mix of both techniquesâ€”using the delegate prototype to share public methods between objects and cloning for data that can't be safely shared between instances.

#### The Flyweight Pattern
The flyweight pattern conserves system resources by storing all reusable properties and methods on a delegate object, as opposed to storing copies of them on every instance. This can save a lot of memory and improve system performance dramatically if there are many objects of the same type.

Imagine you're programming a video game and there is a common enemy that has dozens or hundreds of copies in the game world. Each copy stores the enemy's base stats, such as strength and speed, along with methods for all of its attacks and defenses. It also stores the enemy's position in the game world and current health. You can optimize these objects in JavaScript by storing all of that data on the enemy prototype. When there is a change to the enemy's health or position, those changes are made to the enemy instance, while all the other data and methods are delegated to the prototype:

```var enemyPrototype = {
    name: 'Wolf',
    position: { // Override this with setPosition
      x: 0,
      y: 0
    },
    setPosition: function setPosition (x, y) {
      this.position = {
        x: x,
        y: y
      };
      return this;
    },
    health: 20, // Overrides automatically on change
    bite: function bite() {
    },
    evade: function evade() {
    }
  },

  spawnEnemy = function () {
    return Object.create(enemyPrototype);
  };

test('Flyweight pattern.', function () {
  var wolf1 = spawnEnemy(),
    wolf2 = spawnEnemy();

  wolf1.health = 5;
  ok(wolf2.health = 20,
    'Primitives override automatically.');

  ok(wolf1.setPosition(10, 10)
      .position.x === 10, 'Object override works.');
  equal(wolf2.position.x, 0,
      'The prototype should remain unchanged.');
});
```

**Just be mindful that you'll need to replace member objects and arrays rather than mutate them in place if you want your changes to be instance safe.**

#### Factories
```
var carPrototype = {
    gas: function gas(amount) {
      amount = amount || 10;
      this.mph += amount;
      return this;
    },
    brake: function brake(amount) {
      amount = amount || 10;
      this.mph = ((this.mph - amount) < 0)? 0
        : this.mph - amount;
      return this;
    },
    color: 'pink',
    direction: 0,
    mph: 0
  },

  car = function car(options) {
    return extend(Object.create(carPrototype), options);
  },

  myCar = car({
    color: 'red'
  });

test('Flyweight factory with cloning', function () {
  ok(Object.getPrototypeOf(myCar).gas,
    'Prototype methods are shared.'
  );
});
```

### Composing Objects
Objects can be easily composed together into new objects with `Object.assign()`.

```
const oA = { a: 'a' };
const oB = { b: 'b' };
const c = Object.assign({}, oA, oB); // c becomes { a: 'a', b: 'b' }
```

Note that when you use `Object.assign()`, you must pass a destination object as the first parameter. It is the object that properties will be copied to. If you forget, and omit the destination object, the object you pass in the first argument will be mutated.

## Comparison
Use the `===` comparison whenever possible. It has strict type cheching:
```
3 + 1 === 4; // true
3 + 1 === '4'; // false
```

Using just `==` has no type checking:
```
3 + 1 == 4; // true
3 + 1 == '4'; // true
```

## Ternaries (IF shorthand)
`14 - 7 === 7 ? 'Yep!' : 'Nope.'; // Yep!`

## Iterators
OK, but very much boilerplate:
```
var i,
count = [1, 2, 3],
length = count.length,
text = '';

for (i = 0; i < length; i += 1) {
   text += count[i] + ' ';
}
```

Better, use forEach or simmilar:
```
var count = [1, 2, 3],
text = '';

count.forEach(function (number) {
   text += number + ' ';
});
```

And perhaps even better:
```
var count = [1, 2, 3];
var text = count.reduce((sum, x) => sum + x + ' ', '');
```

## Switch
Simple to miss the `break;` statement which leads to difficult to find bugs.

So better exchange `switch`es with:
```
function doAction(action) {
  var actions = {
    'hack': function () {
      return 'hack';
    },

    'slash': function () {
      return 'slash';
    },

    'run': function () {
      return 'run';
    }
  };

  if (typeof actions[action] !== 'function') {
    throw new Error('Invalid action.');
  }


  return actions[action]();
}
```

## eval()
Simply don't use because it can be a security problem.

## Functions
```
const double = function(x) {
   return x * 2;
}
```

equals

`const double = x => x * 2; //ES6 arrow function`

IMPORTANT: `=>` lacks its own `this` and `arguments`. Also it can't be used as a constructor.

Old way with `arguments`:
```
var sum = function(){
	var args = [].slice.call(arguments)
	  .reduce(function(a, b){ return a + b })
}
sum(1, 2, 3, 4) //=== 10
```

With arrow function:

`var sum = (...numbers) => numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b)`

### Default parameter values
```
const orZero = (n = 0) => n;
orZero(); // 0
orZero(2); // 2
orZero(undefined); // 0
```

### Parameter destructuring with ES6
```
function makeSound({species = 'animal', sound}) {
   console.log('The ' + species + ' says ' + sound + '!');
}

makeSound({
   weight:23,
   sound: 'woof'
})
makeSound({
   species: 'bird',
   weight:23,
   sound: 'chirp'
})
```

### Named parameters
```
var userProto = {
   name: '',
   email: '',
   alias: '',
   showInSearch: true,
   colorScheme: 'light'
};

function createUser(options) {
   return Object.assign({}, userProto, options);
}

var newUser = createUser({
   name: 'Mike',
   showInSearch: true
});
newUser;
```

### Named Function Expressions
For better debugging, don't create anonymous functions at top-levels as this will be hard to stacktrace:
```
var lightbulbAPI = {
    off: function() {},
    on: function() {},
};
```

Better:
```
var lightbulbAPI = {
    off: function off() {},
    on: function on() {},
};
```

### Pure functions / Stateless functions
Pure or stateless functions do not use or modify variables, objects, or arrays that were defined outside the function. So they don't depend on anything else as the input and behave always the same.

```
// pure function
const add10 = (a) => a + 10

// impure function due to external non-constants
let x = 10
const addx = (a) => a + x

// also impure due to side-effect
const setx = (v) => x = v
```

```
// impure, because it changes the input variable
var rotate = function rotate(arr) {
  arr.push(arr.shift());
  return arr;
}

//pure, because it returns a new object instead changing the input
var safeRotate = function safeRotate(arr) {
  var newArray = arr.slice(0);
  newArray.push(newArray.shift());
  return newArray;
}
```

That feature is particularly useful in JavaScript applications, because you often need to manage a lot of asynchronous events. Consequently, time becomes a major factor in code organization.

Because you don't have to worry about clobbering shared data, stateless functions can often be run in parallel, meaning that it's much easier to scale computation horizontally across a large number of worker nodes. In other words, stateless functions are great for high-concurrency applications.

### Recursion
ES5 has a call stack limit! ES6 has removed it!

```
let categories = [
   {id: 'animals', parent: null},
   {id: 'mammmals', parent: 'animals'},
   {id: 'cats', parent: 'mammmals'},
   {id: 'dogs', parent: 'mammmals'},
   {id: 'chihuahua', parent: 'dogs'},
   {id: 'labrador', parent: 'dogs'},
   {id: 'siamese', parent: 'cats'},
   {id: 'persian', parent: 'cats'},
]

let makeTree = (categories, parent) => {
   let node = {};
   categories
      .filter(c => c.parent === parent)
      .forEach(c => node[c.id] = makeTree(categories, c.id));
   return node;
}

console.log(
   JSON.stringify(makeTree(categories, null), null, 2)
);
```


### Rest and Spread
For example, the following function simply discards the first argument and returns the rest as an array:
```
const aTail = (head, ...tail) => tail;
aTail(1, 2, 3); // [2, 3]
```

Spread does the opposite: it spreads the elements from an array to individual elements. Consider this:
```
const shiftToLast = (head, ...tail) => [...tail, head];
shiftToLast(1, 2, 3); // [2, 3, 1]
```

### Currying
Maybe to complicated to be used because of easily made errors! Avoid when possible.

### Partial Application
```
var multiply = (x, y) => x * y;
var boundDouble = multiply.bind(null, 2); // null context
boundDouble(4): // 8
```

The only disadvantage is that you won't be able to override the value of this with .call() or .apply(). If your function uses this, you shouldn't use .bind().

### Function composition (needs check if examples really function composition)
```
const inc = n => n + 1;
const double = n => n * 2;
inc(double(2)); // 5
```

You can pass any expression as an argument to a function. The expression will be evaluated before the function is applied:
`inc(double(2) * double(2)); // 17`

#### 'Piping' functions together
`const pipe = (...fns) => x => fns.reduce((v, f) => f(v), x);`

Now you can write add1ThenDouble() like this:
```
const add1ThenDouble = pipe(add1, double);
add1ThenDouble(2); // ((2 + 1 = 3) * 2 = 6)
```

### Method Chaining
```
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.map(double).map(double); // [4, 8, 12]
```

### Higher-Order-Functions
How JavaScripts `Array.filter()` is build:
```
const reduce = (reducer, initial, arr) => {
   let acc = initial;
   for (let i = 0, length = arr.length; i < length; i++) {
      acc = reducer(acc, arr[i]);
   }
   return acc;
};

const filter = (fn, arr) =>
   reduce((acc, curr) =>
      fn(curr) ? acc.concat([curr]) : acc, [], arr
);

const censor = words => filter(word => word.length !== 4, words);
const startsWithS = words => filter(word => word.startsWith('g'), words);

const wordArray = ['oops', 'gasp', 'shout', 'sun'];
console.log(censor(wordArray)); // [ 'shout', 'sun' ]
console.log(startsWithS(wordArray)); // [ 'gasp' ]
```

## Monads, Functors, and Fancy Words
Monads can be thought of as a container for a value, and to open up the container and do something to the value, you need to map over it. `Array.filter()` is a functor/monad!. Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```
const inc = n => n + 1;
const isZero = n => n === 0;
// monad
list = [-1,0,1]
list.map(inc) // => [0,1,2]
list.map(isZero) // => [false, true, false]
```

```
list.map(inc).map(isZero) // => [true, false, false]
list.map(compose(isZero, inc)) // => [true, false, false]
```

## "Classes", Factories, inheritance and it's best practices
JavaScript has no classes! Even the ES6 `class` desugars to constructor functions! Use them only if unavoidable.

See:

https://medium.com/javascript-scene/javascript-factory-functions-vs-constructor-functions-vs-classes-2f22ceddf33e

https://medium.com/javascript-scene/3-different-kinds-of-prototypal-inheritance-es6-edition-32d777fa16c9

### Factory function (use if possible!)
```
const proto = {
  hello: function hello() {
     console.log(`Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`)
  }
};

const greeter = (name) => Object.assign(Object.create(proto), {name});

const george = greeter('George');
george.hello(); // Hello, my name is George
```

### ES5 constructor function (don't use if possible)
```
function Greeter (name) {
  this.name = name || 'John Doe';
}

Greeter.prototype.hello = function hello() {
  console.log(`Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`)
}

var george = new Greeter('George');
george.hello(); // Hello, my name is George
```

### ES6 class (don't use if possible)
```
class Greeter {
  constructor (name) {
    this.name = name || 'John Doe';
  }
  hello: function hello() {
     console.log(`Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`)
  }
}

const george = new Greeter('George');
george.hello(); // Hello, my name is George
```

### Inheritance
However inheritance comes to life (factory functions, constructor functions or "classes"), don't think in terms of IS-A relationships, but in terms of HAS-A, USES-A or CAN-DO relationships which leads you to composition instead of parent-child inheritance.

### Concatenative Inheritance / Cloning / Mixins
Concatenative inheritance is the process of copying the properties/functions from one object to another, without retaining a reference between the two objects.

```
const proto = {
  hello: function hello() {
     console.log(`Hello, my name is ${ this.name }`)
  }
};

const george = Object.assign({}, proto, {name: 'George'});
george.hello(); // Hello, my name is George
```

### Functional Inheritance
The primary advantage of using functions for extension is that it allows you to use the function closure to encapsulate private data. In other words, you can enforce private state.

```
const rawMixin = function () {
  const attrs = {}; // -> get's private!!

  return Object.assign(this, {
    set (name, value) {
      attrs[name] = value;

      this.emit('change', {
        prop: name,
        value: value
      });
    },

    get (name) {
      return attrs[name];
    }
  }, WhateverElseToApply);
};

const mixinModel = (target) => rawMixin.call(target);

const george = { name: 'george' };
const model = mixinModel(george);

model.on('change', data => console.log(data));

model.set('name', 'Sam');
```

### Composition
```
const barker = (state) => ({
   bark: () => console.log('Woof, I'am ' + state.name');
})
const driver = (state) => ({
   drive: () => state.position = state.position + state.speed;
})
const killer = (state) => ({
   kill: () => console.log('Astalavista, baby!');
})

const murderRobotDog = (name) => {
   let state = {
      name,
      speed: 100,
      position: 0
   }
   return Object.assign(
      {},
      barker(state),
      driver(state),
      killer(state)
   )
}

murderRobotDog('sniffles').bark(); // Woof, I'm sniffles
```

#### Composition with Stamps (stampit.js)
```
const a = init(function () {
  const a = 'a';

  Object.assign(this, {
    getA () { return a; }
  });
});

const b = init(function () {
  const a = 'b';

  Object.assign(this, {
    getB () { return a; }
  });
});

const c = compose(a, b); // Stampit functionality

const foo = c();
console.log(foo.getA()); // 'a'
console.log(foo.getB()); // 'b'
```

```
// Some more privileged methods, with some private data.
const availability = init(function () {
  let isOpen = false; // private

  Object.assign(this, {
    open () {
      isOpen = true;
      return this;
    },
    close () {
      isOpen = false;
      return this;
    },
    isOpen () {
      return isOpen;
    }
  });
});

// Here's a stamp with public methods, and some state:
const membership = compose({
  methods: {
    add (member) {
      this.members[member.name] = member;
      return this;
    },
    getMember (name) {
      return this.members[name];
    }
  },
  properties: {
    members: {}
  }
});

// Let's set some defaults:
const defaults = compose({
  properties: {
    name: 'The Saloon',
    specials: 'Whisky, Gin, Tequila'
  }
});

const overrides = init(function (overrides) {
  Object.assign(this, overrides);
});

// Classical inheritance has nothing on this. No parent/child coupling.
// No deep inheritance hierarchies.
// Just good, clean code reusability.
const bar = compose(availability, membership, defaults, overrides);
const myBar = bar({name: 'Moe\'s'});

// Silly, but proves that everything is as it should be.
const result = myBar.add({name: 'Homer'}).open().getMember('Homer');
console.log(result); // { name: 'Homer' }
console.log(`
  name: ${ myBar.name }
  isOpen: ${ myBar.isOpen() }
  specials: ${ myBar.specials }
`);
/*
  name: Moe's
  isOpen: true
  specials: Whisky, Gin, Tequila
*/
```

## Asynchronous Operations
### Callbacks
Callbacks are functions that you pass as arguments to be invoked when the callee has finished its job. Callbacks are commonly passed into event handlers, Ajax requests, and timers.

### Promises and Deferreds
Better examples needed.

# Examples of nice functional programming

## The greeting mess

We need to greet a user on login. Easy:
`const greeting = (name) => `Hello ${name}`

But wait ... we need more greeting text:
```
const greeting = (name, male=false, female=false) =>
  `Hello ${male ? â€˜Mr. â€˜ : female ? â€˜Ms. â€˜ : â€˜â€™} ${name}`
```

Now it starts getting messier, and we still need moooore greeting text! What now? More parameters, more ifs?

No, just write and compose pure functions!

```
const formalGreeting = (name) => `Hello ${name}`;
const casualGreeting = (name) => `Sup ${name}`;
const male = (name) => `Mr. ${name}`;
const female = (name) => `Mrs. ${name}`;
const doctor = (name) => `Dr. ${name}`;
const phd = (name) => `${name} PhD`;
const md = (name) => `${name} M.D.`;

formalGreeting(male(phd("Chet"))); // => "Hello Mr. Chet PhD"
```

This is a nice approach, but a litte unhandy in use. So lets do this:
```
const pipe = (fns) => (x) => fns.reduce((v, f) => f(v), x); // a helper for 'chaining' functions

const identity = (x) => x; // Simply returns the input value
const greet = (name, options) => {
   return pipe([
      // greeting    
      options.formal ? formalGreeting :
      casualGreeting,

      // prefix
      options.doctor ? doctor :
      options.male ? male :
      options.female ? female :
      identity,

      // suffix
      options.phd ? phd :
      options.md ?md :
      identity
   ])(name)
};
```

Yeah! Thats nice, readable, extensible and good code! :)
